### 1st Granite, 126

Alright, new leader here. What's up Birdclasps?

![Initial status](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/0O2J0b310K3U/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%208.12.28%20PM.png)

I know understand why the old leader ran away screaming about a werebeaver. We
have 2 total dwarves, and I heard Slava yelling about one of the animals being
the werebeaver in question.

I quickly find the 2 alive dwarves left, digging away, like dwarves love doing.
There are lots of corpses around though...

Looking through the stockpiles, I see an interesting character! Turns out its
our expedition leader, who is our turned werebeaver. I'm going to proceed try
wall him off and hope the other two aren't infected. I'll need to keep an eye on
him.

![The werebeast](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2r0l1d3A3N0h/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%208.57.36%20PM.png)

Knowing we only have a couple weeks before he turns again, I cancel all
current mining and start mining out a room. One of the miners goes to take a
drink to help cope with everything he's seen, but can't even bring himself to
drink his sorrows away.

![How sad](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2C090u2n0m1n/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%209.21.03%20PM.png)

I look at the old "Containment" burrow and just giggle. If this was containment,
why the hell can dwarves easily get in and out?! Whatever I delete it and move
on. I remove all the dutys of Shorast so he can't remove the walls later.

![RIP Werebeaver](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1f1C01052p3X/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%2010.03.38%20PM.png)

I give the two living dwarves bedrooms because they deserve to sleep well and
are still sleeping in the dormitory. Turns out the other beds weren't even
bedrooms.

I take away Shorast's leader status and name Kubuk some roles. Once I let him
know of his promotion, I tell him he reminds me of a young me, and he then
demands to be called "Skalnik" as well. Whatever weirdo.

![Skalnik](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/0x343m2m2v3m/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%2010.12.09%20PM.png)

Impressively, Skalnik picks up right where the previous manager left off.
However things have changed since then. We need lots of coffins to contain our
dead.

![Job queue](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1g0S1O1x3B3F/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-18%20at%2010.16.43%20PM.png)

### 13th Granite, 126

An elevan caravan shows up! Just ignore the corpses and blood everywhere. It'll
be fine.

![Elves](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2L402A0r2F15/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%207.17.27%20PM.png)

Sidenote: I thought to check little Skalnik's kills, and find he's hilled a
dwarf. We'll see if he turns...

Suddenly the old containment area fills with miasma, and I notice Skalnik &
Shorast, the definite werebeaver. Shit. This is bad in 2 cases. One, how the
hell did he get into Shorast's containment?! Second, WHY ARE THE TALKING. This
is going to be !!fun!!

![Friendly chats](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2T3f3503120O/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%207.28.25%20PM.png)

Uhhh, I guess the best possible outcome happened, which was Shorast turned,
proceeded to murder little Skalnik, and then turned back. Still one dwarf!
Hilariously, little Skalnik was killed by being hit in the head with a alpaca
wool sock.

![Skalnik's death](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2h010M272A3F/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%207.43.06%20PM.png)

I investigate how the hell little Skalnik got into the Werebeaver containment,
and see that one wall is yet to be built, but there's a pilar next to it. I made
both walls. Not sure whats up there, but the werebeaver is still contained, so
theres that. I also resume all previous digging and tell the last dwarvf to also
place that wall.

![Restarting the dig](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2S1Z3p1i0b3V/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.03.49%20PM.png)

I see the merchants are leaving soon, so I cancel all other jobs for Led, the
last dwarf, so we can get some trade going. He's currently drinking so I'll give
him a bit of a break.

![Drinkin](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1x0r0w130n00/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.09.26%20PM.png)

### 18th Slate, 126

Before Led can get to doing anything, MIGRANTS ARRIVE! Oh god, we may last
another year. The merchants leave, but who the fuck cares. MIGRANTS! We are now
20 dwarves and 1 werebeaver strong.

![Status](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2Q0J1J0y2E0z/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.14.27%20PM.png)

I quickly shuffle nobles around and begin building a large fancy bedroom for
Led, because they survived The Werebeavers of 125. Also, I work on building a
dedicated cemetary on a separate floor

![New rooms](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1i0H3f3i3d41/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.46.31%20PM.png)

Unsurprsingly, the new migrants are having lots of feels. Canceling jobs due to
just the shock of the current status of Birdclasps. Sorry guys, but we can all
make this better together, hopefully before the end of the year.

!["cancels Fish: Horrified"](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/231X3r430T47/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.51.36%20PM.png)

Oh fuck off, you have got to be kidding me.

![A wereshrew](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/3y420K2D3q2v/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-23%20at%208.52.32%20PM.png)

And of course we don't have a fucking lever for the damn bridge yet. OF COURSE.
Lets get on that *right now* as I monitor this asshole. As I dig out a small
place dedicated for the lever, I notice our new migrant farmer just fell into
our moat. This also needs to get filled with water soon.

![New place for the lever](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2z2V1x3w2N31/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%209.33.22%20PM.png)

The wereshrew turns back to a human and runs. It looks like he fought 1 dwarf
who didn't die. Sorry but you're going to get walled off now. I nicknamed him
for good measure so I don't lose track.

![The wereshrew dwarf](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/0H3Y2U0a130F/2014-08-26%20at%209.31%20PM.png)

I contain him to a burrow outside as we dig a room for him to spend the rest of
his eternal life

![Burrow](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2z2V1x3w2N31/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%209.33.22%20PM.png)

While I start smelting some things to make new picks so digging can restart in
large quantities, the ghosts start to rise. This'll be great.

![Ghosts](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1r1Z3J2V1z0B/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-26%20at%2010.58.12%20AM.png)

Realizing I won't have the Wereshrew containment ready by the time he turns, I
go to move his burrow really far away. However, I notice he's now missing.
Crisis averted? Delayed? WHO KNOWS!

![Missing](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/3D2s1e1v2p23/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-27%20at%202.50.06%20PM.png)

First ghost I've ever seen and he's loving hanging out with the Werebeaver and
a decaying corpse.

![Ghost chillin](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/450C3N0u1t0w/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-27%20at%202.59.45%20PM.png)

And thus spring comes to a close.
