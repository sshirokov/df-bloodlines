### 15th Granite, 125, Early Spring

Every masterwork begins with the first step.

I decide that the best way forward is down. I declare an area a staircase down, directly in the earth.
I will build a wall around it if it kills me.

The trees around us, they should not be. I ask them gone. I pray Armok the elves visit us.

There's no time for "Fishing" at a time like this! This calls for therapy

*Kivish Gusilnoram*, the expedition leader as well *Kubuk Ragkonos* and *Abel Kadolakmesh* are
relieved of hauling, as they should be focusing on digging holes, and thiking big thoughs.

### 16th Granite, 125, Early Spring

Based on his posiiton in society, *Kivish* suddenly takes on a new name.

He mumbles something about standing out in listings and being easy to spot. I'm going to keep my eye on him.

We'll be placing our farms two levels down from the ground, in Silt.

It's next to a *Bituminous coal* deposit, so two birds will be murdered here.

We're only four layers deep so far, stairs all the way down.

### 17th Granite, 125, Early Spring

A layer below the farms, I will create the general stockpile. Things will move out as space is made elsewhere.

![Space here now though](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3X363F122n0Q/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.07.25%20PM.png)

Onece more below that, a dining hall, attached to what will be the kitchen and brewing complex.

A place for refuse is designeated, outdoors and a few steps from the entrance. It includes corpses. Practicality
above all.

![Trash](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0H3R1I450f0J/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.08.52%20PM.png)

With all of this in motion, nothing can possibly go wrong. :beers:

### 28th Granite, 125, Early Spring

As if by some divine knowledge, the dwarves focus on digging out the dining hall. Either that, or someone has
been stealing my notes.

It is completed quickly, and becomes a temporary meeting area.

### 1st Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

Our greeting to any passing elves is complete
