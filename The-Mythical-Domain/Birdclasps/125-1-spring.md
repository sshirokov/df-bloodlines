### 15th Granite, 125, Early Spring

Every masterwork begins with the first step.

![Status](http://f.cl.ly/items/251p0u1D2X0b061u1K1k/Image%202014-08-07%20at%208.49.18%20PM.png)

I decide that the best way forward is down. I declare an area a staircase down, directly in the earth.
I will build a wall around it if it kills me.

![Dig](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0p0j2N2O2m10/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2010.47.41%20PM.png)

The trees around us, they should not be. I ask them gone. I pray Armok the elves visit us.

![Trees are stupid](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1L0s1n3I3M3I/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2010.50.31%20PM.png)

There's no time for "Fishing" at a time like this! This calls for therapy

![Fising..](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0E1p3i213M35/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2010.51.56%20PM.png)

*Kivish Gusilnoram*, the expedition leader as well *Kubuk Ragkonos* and *Abel Kadolakmesh* are
relieved of hauling, as they should be focusing on digging holes, and thiking big thoughs.

![How do you REALLY feel](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2X3A222n1I3l/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2010.55.01%20PM.png)

### 16th Granite, 125, Early Spring

Based on his posiiton in society, *Kivish* suddenly takes on a new name.

![Putin](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1U3M2C0M2E09/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.00.09%20PM.png)

He mumbles something about standing out in listings and being easy to spot. I'm going to keep my eye on him.

We'll be placing our farms two levels down from the ground, in Silt.

![Futurefarm](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3n293h302c1k/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.01.22%20PM.png)

It's next to a *Bituminous coal* deposit, so two birds will be murdered here.

![Futrefarm designated](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/020w2D2v2o3B/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.06.37%20PM.png)

We're only four layers deep so far, stairs all the way down.

### 17th Granite, 125, Early Spring

A layer below the farms, I will create the general stockpile. Things will move out as space is made elsewhere.

![Space here now though](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3X363F122n0Q/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.07.25%20PM.png)

Onece more below that, a dining hall, attached to what will be the kitchen and brewing complex.

![Ambition](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0J3R172A0v3b/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.11.41%20PM.png)

A place for refuse is designeated, outdoors and a few steps from the entrance. It includes corpses. Practicality
above all.

![Trash](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0H3R1I450f0J/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.08.52%20PM.png)

With all of this in motion, nothing can possibly go wrong. :beers:

### 28th Granite, 125, Early Spring

As if by some divine knowledge, the dwarves focus on digging out the dining hall. Either that, or someone has
been stealing my notes.

![Dining](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0R0t3i1K0Q3s/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.17.16%20PM.png)

It is completed quickly, and becomes a temporary meeting area.

![Meet](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3f2L022N1q0g/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.18.26%20PM.png)

### 1st Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

Our greeting to any passing elves is complete

![Wood everywhere](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1N2O1R1Z3O11/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.19.38%20PM.png)

### 5th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

A still is the first structure built

![A still](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0u1m2X2A0s2q/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.22.16%20PM.png)

### 7th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

*Abel Kadolakmesh* proves that practice makes perfect

![Perfectish, at least](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1N1j3u0e1d0h/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.23.38%20PM.png)

### 9th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

*Olon Onulmishos* begins work on the kitchen.

![Kitchen](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1Y2C2v173n47/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.26.18%20PM.png)

Just as the general stockpile is complete

![General](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0E273j060R2v/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.28.31%20PM.png)

![Stock](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1O0z1q3A0h2L/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.29.02%20PM.png)

I'll forbid classes of items are more general stockpiles are built.

### 12th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

My farming designation was not quite where it needed to be. I dig northwards.

![Wooooops](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0K0t3t451b1A/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.31.05%20PM.png)

It takes until the *16th Slate* to create the plots and a seed stockpile.

![Plots and pile](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1S3F2s3Y401n/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.36.48%20PM.png)

The top four plots will grow plump helmets year-round. The bottom will grow a grab bag of what I find available.

### 19th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

Since planning has worked out so far, I plan the layer of industry. It will go exactly as planned.

![Industry](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2w1Y1n1Q1r0W/2014-08-07%20at%2011.43%20PM.png)

### 24th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

The horseshit and cramped workspaces reminded me. I have no fucking pasture. This is quickly corrected.
The future-meat is stacked next to the refuse pile outdoors.

![Graseaters](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1i3p3406411j/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.49.14%20PM.png)

### 5th Felsite, 125, Late Spring

We are in the wood business

![Wood](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2F2I2T0Y0L09/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.54.06%20PM.png)

### 6th Felsite, 125, Late Spring

![Sleep](http://f.cl.ly/items/1w1K372r2k2t2J461b0g/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.55.20%20PM.png)

The miners *Kubuk Clappedbrass* and *Abel Gemtempest* take a nap as they build the mason's workshopatorium. It's not like the entire
freaking fort is waiting for them or anything.

![Kubuk](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3g0p1e2L1x2b/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.57.24%20PM.png)

![Abel](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1S3e0i2N2t2M/Image%202014-08-07%20at%2011.58.02%20PM.png)

The sooner they finish, the sooner everyone can stop what they're doing.

### 8th Felsite, 125, Late Spring

Preparations are made for *Putin* to be installed as leader by constructing furniture.

![Furniture](http://f.cl.ly/items/0B1N373H2W441Q0S100Y/Image%202014-08-08%20at%2012.03.38%20AM.png)

He refuses the title until they are built.
