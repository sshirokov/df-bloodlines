Autumn
------

### 1st Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

We're more than we've ever been. I'm proud of each Dwarf.

Progress continues on stockpile expansion.

![Piles of :poop:](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0y2w28261h2F/Image%202014-08-08%20at%204.37.32%20PM.png)

### 4th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Stockpile expansion is completed three days later. The middle is designed for furniture, the eastern
stores finished goods.

![Done](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1B2I2I2C0P29/Image%202014-08-08%20at%204.42.11%20PM.png)

Plans go down for the layouts of the wood burner, the smelter and the forge. New stockpiles will
be built to hold ore, fuel, and resulting bars.

![Plans within plans](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2y161s2G3Y37/2014-08-09%20at%204.38%20PM.png)

There should be room for expansion in there somewhere, if the sprawl continues. I am becoming haunted
by dreams of winter. I declare the moat dug immediatly.

![Moat](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0h402p2v2V25/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.43.06%20PM.png)

A bridge will close it in time. Too much time.

### 10th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

A caravan from *Bembulrovod* has arrived. Our people!

![Here they are](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/060j3s1E2D0v/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.50.31%20PM.png)

![Our people](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2R1v0k3q1z0M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.51.39%20PM.png)

We'll sell them our finest, uh, things!

I'll suspend construction of part of our moat for their arrival.

![Stop that](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3j092M2r3R1F/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.53.15%20PM.png)

### 14th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

In the middle of the preparations, *Dodok Kamukobok* gives birth!

![Birth](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2s0H360N261E/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.55.49%20PM.png)

![Dodok](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0i1r140u2R08/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.56.36%20PM.png)

The baby is a healthy (for now, as she is slow to heal) girl, with an iffy memory.
Happy birthday, *Doren Kolebal*. May you become productive soon enough. Despite your feelings
on craftsmanship.

*(And good luck with that water thing in the winter)*

![Baby](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1x3i0f1p1J3i/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.00.13%20PM.png)

....joy of joys....

Not to be outdone, *Ablel Kadolakmesh*, Miner aslso gives birth.

![Round 2](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3g3A121d0Q0q/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.06.29%20PM.png)

She is the daughter of *Ablel Kadolakmesh* and *Udib Shipinsight*. She is born with braids and
a taste for papaya wine and poor creative and analytical skills.

I'm sure her flimsiness will come in handy one day

![Flimsy baby](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3e1V1M2u2k2L/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.07.33%20PM.png)

Welcome to the world.

### 18th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

I ask all the crafts we made this year, and in fact all the crafts in our possession moved to the
trade depot.

![Trade time](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1v1A0h243c3m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.16.53%20PM.png)

The trader is requested there. Let's see what we can get.

### 19th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Work on the moat finally begins.

![Moat](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3t1w2G204731/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.17.50%20PM.png)

### 25th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Until today *Putin* would sneak off in secret and practice his hobby of woodworking. This was stopped.
He must focus on his duties as a leader, not as a carpenter.

We instantly make a trade agreement.

![Our futures](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0I3S1f1w3h0T/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.23.21%20PM.png)

### 2nd Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

In preparation as the leader of the armed forces, *Thob Utharnokim* is told to do nothing but hunt.

![Therapist orders](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2P383r1j1g1m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.30.43%20PM.png)

Therapist's orders.

A butcher is planned to accommodate his efforts.

![Butchery here](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/092z3f0y2B0d/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.33.21%20PM.png)

### 5th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

Trading begins. I hope they like our garbage trash.

![Trashtrade](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2T2y0t1N3d2m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.36.50%20PM.png)

Not sure how to tell the craftsdwarfves this, but they need to up their game, I'm only asking
for some cloth, some booze, and some bolts.

![Meany](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0M3c0Y2G0O1M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.44.50%20PM.png)

Greedy dwarf. We're supposed to be neighbors.

![Some profit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1m2E0t3M1O2C/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.45.43%20PM.png)

Fine, no booze

![More profit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2D2P2m3I0d0R/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.46.25%20PM.png)

This is not going very well. At least he didn't have much of anything I was desperate for.

![Fucker](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0D2m032R1q3U/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.47.04%20PM.png)

Would have been nice to have some bolts though..

### 18th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

Some **MORE** migrants have arrived.

![More of them](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/32371U302h2L/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.57.50%20PM.png)

We are now **29**

![Status](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/342r1m2q3h3t/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.59.27%20PM.png)


### 24th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

The updated plans for the industrial center have been completed. The forge, smelter and
wood burning furnace are all installed, the stockpiles are in place, and a new proposal
for economic stone storage is in the works.

![More rocks and rock accessories](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1918143V1T0T/Image%202014-08-09%20at%206.05.59%20PM.png)

### 8th Timber, 125, Late Autumn

To put it mildly..

#### We are fucked. Everyone is going to die. There is no coming back now.

![The night](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0W2a0s232J1P/Image%202014-08-09%20at%206.12.23%20PM.png)

At the very least, someone might get very hurt. My preparations for combat so far have included:

  * Do not prepare for combat

There might be an off-chance that one of the hunters might be a good fighter? From here, the plan
is to design a burrow, a military, and an alert level for this situation.

While everyone goes inside, hopefully the *Werebeaver* can just attack some animals, or maybe change back
and run away.

A locked floor hatch should hold him back.

Though, this isn't the most menacing description

![Scrawny](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2k2k2S0x2m2B/2014-08-09%20at%206.16%20PM.png)

He appeared near our refuse pile.

![Trash creature near trash](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0S1P3Q1F390p/2014-08-09%20at%206.18%20PM.png)

**STRIKE THE BEAVER!** *(BUT MOSTLY RUN AND HIDE)*

Everything two layers below ground and downwards is now a burrow. I will use this to restrict civilians.

![Save](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3l1J1z3o2E3B/Image%202014-08-09%20at%209.42.09%20PM.png)

*Thob Utharnokim* will now have to answer the call to form *The Laborious Obstacles*,
a fitting name for what's ahead.

![Army Force One](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3h36200f2r0m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%209.46.46%20PM.png)

An alert is created, and knowledge of it spread. It is called **Get Underground** and it mandates that
all civilians restrict their actions to the *Underground* burrow.

![Alerts](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1I3x0s3x2M2H/Image%202014-08-09%20at%209.49.56%20PM.png)

Preparations can only go so far. With the alert active, the *"military"* is ordered to the surface,
ready to do what they can to face the beast.

![Move](http://f.cl.ly/items/0Y1n3h2U0J3l2r082P0a/Image%202014-08-09%20at%209.53.40%20PM.png)

**Armok help us.**

![Almost the start](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2f1t3b3e0I37/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.10.32%20PM.png)

Why didn't I build that bridge.

The military is ordered to the front line as the weredbadger fights our livestock.

![Go](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1a3i0q2A2y3M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.13.06%20PM.png)

The *Stray Yak Cow* defense force is holding, as some cowards run to the north. Good for them.
They're safer there.

![Fight](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0b0g031V3B1h/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.15.22%20PM.png)

*The Laborious Obstacles* now have very clear orders

![Kill](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/463H1U0p0B3l/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.16.27%20PM.png)

*Meng Olonegen* is first on the scene.

![The scene](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3d0Y0P1R3e3k/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.17.18%20PM.png)

May history remember her.

![The battle begins](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1u2n3c1u1E3p/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.18.03%20PM.png)

Not a lot of action in the fight though...

![The fight as they call it](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1D133i1B0W2l/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.19.51%20PM.png)

It seems the tables have turned, and now I'm just going to murder this goblin child

![Death to goblins anyway, I guess](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0p1G243z0h0i/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.22.38%20PM.png)

Lucky for him, he's very fast. He runs north-west, away from *Birdclasps*

![Gone](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0N3g1Y2n0X2b/2014-08-09%20at%2010.25%20PM.png)

It's time to cancel the orders and lower the alerts.

![Cancel](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1q0W1O3w1y1l/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.27.31%20PM.png)

![Alarms](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1X241e241m1I/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.28.15%20PM.png)

As we mourn the loss of *Meng Olonegen*.

![Death](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1m290h2f100n/Image%202014-08-09%20at%2010.29.00%20PM.png)

She saved many in the battle of the Werebadger, Timber, 125. The date **Birdclasps** proved it was worth defending.

Unlike *Thob Utharnokim*. Who is a coward of a leader. He stayed back for the entire battle. History would do
well to forget him.

![Coward](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3w3e1V0B0q0u/2014-08-14%20at%2012.22%20AM.png)
