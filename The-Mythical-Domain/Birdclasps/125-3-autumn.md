Autumn

### 1st Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

We're more than we've ever been. I'm proud of each Dwarf.

Progress continues on stockpile expansion.

![Piles of :poop:](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0y2w28261h2F/Image%202014-08-08%20at%204.37.32%20PM.png)

### 4th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Stockpile expansion is completed three days later. The middle is designed for furniture, the eastern
stores finished goods.

![Done](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1B2I2I2C0P29/Image%202014-08-08%20at%204.42.11%20PM.png)

Plans go down for the layouts of the wood burner, the smelter and the forge. New stockpiles will
be built to hold ore, fuel, and resulting bars.

There should be room for expansion in there somewhere, if the sprawl continues. I am becoming haunted
by dreams of winter. I declare the moat dug immediatly.

![Moat](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0h402p2v2V25/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.43.06%20PM.png)

A bridge will close it in time. Too much time.

### 10th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

A caravan from *Bembulrovod* has arrived. Our people!

![Here they are](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/060j3s1E2D0v/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.50.31%20PM.png)

![Our people](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2R1v0k3q1z0M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.51.39%20PM.png)

We'll sell them our finest, uh, things!

I'll suspend construction of part of our moat for their arrival.

![Stop that](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3j092M2r3R1F/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.53.15%20PM.png)

### 14th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

In the middle of the preparations, *Dodok Kamukobok* gives birth!

![Birth](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2s0H360N261E/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.55.49%20PM.png)

![Dodok](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0i1r140u2R08/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.56.36%20PM.png)

The baby is a healthy (for now, as she is slow to heal) girl, with an iffy memory.
Happy birthday, *Doren Kolebal*. May you become productive soon enough. Despite your feelings
on craftsmanship.

*(And good luck with that water thing in the winter)*

![Baby](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1x3i0f1p1J3i/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.00.13%20PM.png)

....joy of joys....

Not to be outdone, *Ablel Kadolakmesh*, Miner aslso gives birth.

She is the daughter of *Ablel Kadolakmesh* and *Udib Shipinsight*. She is born with braids and
a taste for papaya wine and poor creative and analytical skills.

I'm sure her flimsiness will come in handy one day

![Flimsy baby](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3e1V1M2u2k2L/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.07.33%20PM.png)

Welcome to the world.

### 18th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

I ask all the crafts we made this year, and in fact all the crafts in our possession moved to the
trade depot.

![Trade time](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1v1A0h243c3m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.16.53%20PM.png)

The trader is requested there. Let's see what we can get.

### 19th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Work on the moat finally begins.

![Moat](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3t1w2G204731/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.17.50%20PM.png)

### 25th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Until today *Putin* would sneak off in secret and practice his hobby of woodworking. This was stopped.
He must focus on his duties as a leader, not as a carpenter.

We instantly make a trade agreement.

### 2nd Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

In preparation as the leader of the armed forces, *Thob Utharnokim* is told to do nothing but hunt.

![Therapist orders](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2P383r1j1g1m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.30.43%20PM.png)

Therapist's orders.

A butcher is planned to accommodate his efforts.

![Butchery here](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/092z3f0y2B0d/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.33.21%20PM.png)

### 5th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

Trading begins. I hope they like our garbage trash.

![Trashtrade](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2T2y0t1N3d2m/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.36.50%20PM.png)

Not sure how to tell the craftsdwarfves this, but they need to up their game, I'm only asking
for some cloth, some booze, and some bolts.

![Meany](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0M3c0Y2G0O1M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.44.50%20PM.png)

Greedy dwarf. We're supposed to be neighbors.

![Some profit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1m2E0t3M1O2C/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.45.43%20PM.png)

Fine, no booze

![More profit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2D2P2m3I0d0R/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.46.25%20PM.png)

This is not going very well. At least he didn't have much of anything I was desperate for.

![Fucker](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0D2m032R1q3U/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.47.04%20PM.png)

Would have been nice to have some bolts though..

### 18th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

Some **MORE** migrants have arrived.

![More of them](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/32371U302h2L/Image%202014-08-09%20at%205.57.50%20PM.png)

We are now **29**

### 24th Sandstone, 125, Mid-Autumn

The updated plans for the industrial center have been completed. The forge, smelter and
wood burning furnace are all installed, the stockpiles are in place, and a new proposal
for economic stone storage is in the works.

![More rocks and rock accessories](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1918143V1T0T/Image%202014-08-09%20at%206.05.59%20PM.png)

### 8th Timber, 125, Late Autumn

We are fucked. Everyone is going to die. There is no coming back now.

![The night](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0W2a0s232J1P/Image%202014-08-09%20at%206.12.23%20PM.png)

At the very least, someone might get very hurt. My preparations for combat so far have included:

  * Do not prepare for combat

There might be an off-chance that one of the hunters might be a good fighter? From here, the plan
is to design a burrow, a military, and an alert level for this situation.

While everyone goes inside, hopefully the *Werebeaver* can just attack some animals, or maybe change back
and run away.

A locked floor hatch should hold him back.

Though, this isn't the most menacing description

![Scrawny](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2k2k2S0x2m2B/2014-08-09%20at%206.16%20PM.png)

He appeared near our refuse pile.
