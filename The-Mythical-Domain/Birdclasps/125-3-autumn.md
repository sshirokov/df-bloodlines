### 1st Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

We're more than we've ever been. I'm proud of each Dwarf.

Progress continues on stockpile expansion.

### 4th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

Stockpile expansion is completed three days later. The middle is designed for furniture, the eastern
stores finished goods.

Plans go down for the layouts of the wood burner, the smelter and the forge. New stockpiles will
be built to hold ore, fuel, and resulting bars.

There should be room for expansion in there somewhere, if the sprawl continues. I am becoming haunted
by dreams of winter. I declare the moat dug immediatly.

A bridge will close it in time. Too much time.

### 10th Limestone, 125, Early Autumn

A caravan from *Bembulrovod* has arrived. Our people!

![Here they are](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/060j3s1E2D0v/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.50.31%20PM.png)

![Our people](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2R1v0k3q1z0M/Image%202014-08-09%20at%204.51.39%20PM.png)

We'll sell them our finest, uh, things!

I'll suspend construction of part of our moat for their arrival.
