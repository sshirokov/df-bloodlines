Autumn
------

### 1st Limestone, 126, Autumn

When I arrived earlier this year, this fortress was a blood bath and I thought
it'd soon be gone. However, we're quite strong now and doing well. I'm proud of
all the migrants who have shown up to make this happen.

I'm most impressed and happy with Led, who I now rename to 'Skalnik' to honor my
great rule. Lets hope his fate is better than the first, who was killed almost
instantly by a Werebeaver.

Since my dwarves won't cross water, I command them to build a small bridge to
try to save Tekkud, the dwarf stuck in a tree. Lets see if they can finish it
before he dies.

While our cemetery is still being dug and built out, I place a bunch of coffins
and all the engraved slabs we have so far. Our ghost problem is put to rest.

### 15th Limestone, 126

A caravan shows! I ask for some military supplies and food, because I am not
sure what else to ask for.

To give my predecessor some sort of legacy, I rename the Werebeaver to 'Slava'.
He'll get to hang out with 'Skalnik's rotting corpse and skeleton in the future.

I figure my dwarves aren't that busy, I'll fill this moat. While a dry moat
means it doesn't freeze over in the winter, we want to prevent trees. I hope in
the future that its filled with magma.

Our moat quickly begins to fill.

### 22nd Sandstone, 126

More migrants! They arrive, despite the danger (so the game tells me). We are
now 47 (and 1 werebeaver) strong.

Kadol Tholmeng is now possesed. They quickly claim a Craftdwarf's workshop and
start gathering things.

Kadol makes a pretty baller ring out of bituminous coal :ring:

And thus marks the end of Autumn.
