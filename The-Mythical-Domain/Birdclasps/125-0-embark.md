Birdclasps
----------

*Birdclasps* is the first dwarven fort established in *The Mythical Domain*, with diligent oversight.
Great things are expected.

It was established by @sshirokov, in Granite, 125.

### The search for *Birdclasps*

We are here, in *The Light Forests*, next to *The Skinny Barb*, a mountain. The mountain was necessary.

It has everything we could want, flux, metals, soil. The river *Footoils* runs near us.

### Embarking

Since preparation is for Elves, we will embark with the first people that follow us.

And so we arrive, prepared as ever. I declare the site of our future Grand Mountainhome **Birdclasps**
It will remind us, into eternity, that birds are fucking assholes.
