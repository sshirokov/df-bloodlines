### 8th Hematite, 125, Early Summer

Today is the day we organize under leadership. And the day `Putin` gets a real job.

### 14th Hematite, 125, Early Summer

Construction of bedrooms is designated many layers below the layers of industry. I have set aside
space for a dormitory, and some private apartments. They will be filled as production keeps up.

### 8th Galena, 125, Late Summer

Time for the construction of the wall-to-become-tower of *Birdclasps*. The perimeter is built of
Claystone. A drawbridge will fill the gap to the trade depot, over a moat.
