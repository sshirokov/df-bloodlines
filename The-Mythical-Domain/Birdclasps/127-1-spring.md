# Spring - 127 

## 1st Granite 

I'll be bringing some much need discipline and security to the fortess (hopefully).

Here's what I'm starting with:

I've done a a quick pass over what kind of defense we have:

And that's about it as far as our defense go. 

Let's get a quick overview of our current military:

It looks as if we have a military in name only and possibly no better than a high school wrestling team. To be fair, for a bit our dwarves could only train by wrestling.

Moving on to the current schedule:

And it doesn't look like we'll be training without 10 squad members, which we don't have.

And that's the starting state of our military. 

With that in mind, I'd like to get some archers trained since we a ton of lumber just laying around:

To further that goal I'm extending the barracks with an archery range:
