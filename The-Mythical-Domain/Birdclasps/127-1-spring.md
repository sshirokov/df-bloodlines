# Spring - 127 

## 1st Granite 

I'll be bringing some much need discipline and security to the fortess (hopefully).

Here's what I'm starting with:

I've done a a quick pass over what kind of defense we have:

![bridge](http://cl.ly/image/1E2q1P0f203p/2014-09-21%20at%2012.53%20PM.png)

And that's about it as far as our defense go. 

Let's get a quick overview of our current military:

![current military](http://cl.ly/image/0l0w411G1v25/2014-09-21%20at%201.14%20PM.png)
![uniforms](http://cl.ly/image/3z3v3h1W1e1V/2014-09-21%20at%201.16%20PM.png)

It looks as if we have a military in name only and possibly no better than a high school wrestling team. To be fair, for a bit our dwarves could only train by wrestling.

Moving on to the current schedule:

![schedule](http://cl.ly/image/1K3k3T0Z1x1x/2014-09-21%20at%201.19%20PM.png)

And it doesn't look like we'll be training without 10 squad members, which we don't have.

And that's the starting state of our military. 

With that in mind, I'd like to get some archers trained since we a ton of lumber just laying around:

![outside lumber](http://cl.ly/image/1K0Z3R0g143z/2014-09-21%20at%201.10%20PM.png)

To further that goal I'm extending the barracks with an archery range:

It looks like 'Slava' our resident werebeaver just transformed back into a dwarf.
I like to think the following event is related:

Congratulations are in order for the new mayor of Birdclasps :tada:

Maybe he'll bring the change needed for this fort to prosper.

But he is also needy: ![to be fulfilled](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n4m4hpfixqz828l/2014-09-21%20at%203.19%20PM%20%281%29.png?dl=0)

Plans are currently being drawn out to fulfil these needs. I hope we have the workforce to complete this project in a reasonable amount of time.

Time to put the manager to work in the interest of us all.

That's right training weapons are coming being made. 

I'll need some fresh recruits as I've axe'd (get it :laughing: :question:) the previous lot. I'm going to be scouring our dwarves and seeing who is useful and who is not in Dwarf Therapist.

Looks like Golbins showed up before anything was possible. Let's see if we can burrow and make it through.

Not everyone made it:

We will make it through this and we will be stronger for it.

The bridge is up and and I've removed the *civilian alert*

Another event occuring at the same time as the siege is a new mysterious construction.

An internal strife has started: the tantrum spiral.

Hopefully, it's containable.

We've got a new artifact:

Metalocalypse we became with death taking quite a few dwarves from us:

This tantrum spiral has taken a toll on the workfoce, no usable masons exist: 

![mason seeks child](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/g6payoycs85j2uq/2014-09-21%20at%207.32%20PM.png?dl=0)

And someone really wants their kid.


On the architecture side we've tried to provide a water source and eventually a new well:

Everyone is going mad!

Thankfully in this case the person being interrupted was a swordsdwarf and took that crazy herbalist out. :skull:
