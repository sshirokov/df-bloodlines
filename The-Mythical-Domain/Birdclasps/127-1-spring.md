# Spring - 127 

## 1st Granite 

I'll be bringing some much need discipline and security to the fortess (hopefully).

Here's what I'm starting with:

I've done a a quick pass over what kind of defense we have:

And that's about it as far as our defense go. 

Let's get a quick overview of our current military:

It looks as if we have a military in name only and possibly no better than a high school wrestling team. To be fair, for a bit our dwarves could only train by wrestling.

Moving on to the current schedule:

And it doesn't look like we'll be training without 10 squad members, which we don't have.

And that's the starting state of our military. 

With that in mind, I'd like to get some archers trained since we a ton of lumber just laying around:

To further that goal I'm extending the barracks with an archery range:

It looks like 'Slava' our resident werebeaver just transformed back into a dwarf.
I like to think the following event is related:

Maybe he'll bring the change needed for this fort to prosper.

But he is also needy: ![to be fulfilled](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n4m4hpfixqz828l/2014-09-21%20at%203.19%20PM%20%281%29.png?dl=0)

Plans are currently being drawn out to fulfil these needs. I hope we have the workforce to complete this project in a reasonable amount of time.

Time to put the manager to work in the interest of us all.

That's right training weapons are coming being made. 

I'll need some fresh recruits as I've axe'd (get it :laughing: :question:) the previous lot. I'm going to be scouring our dwarves and seeing who is useful and who is not in Dwarf Therapist.
