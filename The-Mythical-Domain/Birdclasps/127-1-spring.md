Logem Likotison, a stonecrafting bastard, who apparently doesn't even like
crafting has been elected mayor.

After much time, I've finally cleaned up the professions the way I like them.
There are only dedicated jobs now. Most of which have 1 dwarf, so that they may
become the best of their craft. Only Haulers may haul, with the exception of
Brokers.

I actually like using garbage dumps for just stone and gems. I've created the
