Thanks to @skalnik management, we now suffer from a lack of inebriation.

Logem Likotison, a stonecrafting bastard, who apparently doesn't even like
crafting has been elected mayor.

After much time, I've finally cleaned up the professions the way I like them.
There are only dedicated jobs now. Most of which have 1 dwarf, so that they may
become the best of their craft. Only Haulers may haul, with the exception of
Brokers.

I actually like using garbage dumps for just stone and gems. I've created the
zone and the stockpile and will now use 'd'-'b'-'d' to designate dump items.

### 5th Granite, 127, Early Spring

Oh fuck. Not even started and already a siege.

From what I can tell, 8 goblins have arrived to steal my fortunes. And we still
suffer from a lack of ale. Were also running low on food.

To mitigate this attack I'll have to set a civilian burrow zone.

And comb over who my marksdwarves are. Wish I had that well. :(

In an effort to make sure we start brewing shit, I removed both lavish meal
jobs. Then turned off cooking of any plants. We have PLENTY of lavish meals for
now, 326 to be exact.

Civilian alert, Get Underground, has been issued.

Need to figure out whos in a squad next and which lever is linked.

Also looks like the squad formed is inactive. Thus they are somewhat useless to
me. I'll reassign these squads as I see fit.

Cleaned up uniforms.

New squads.

Steel Reserve contains JUST the militia commander, Erib Fatetreaty. Whom will
stay out of combat, as I would like him to become the best he can be. In fact I
will let him continue to mine.

Mahogany Melancholy is a marksdwarf squad. It contains a marksdwarves uniform
assignment. I'll set there training grounds and burrows next.

Long live Mistem Erushtathtak, the Herbalist. How gruesome his death was, to be
bashed alive by a goblin maceman. :cry:
