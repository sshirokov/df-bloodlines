Winter

### 1st Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Things are happening, I think, but now it's a race against time and space.

![Yep](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2t170O260F0F/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.27.42%20AM.png)

As the rivers froze, I realized an important thing. I blocked everyone from the fort.

The moat was finished, but the bridge wasn't even planned. Before we can have bones, we'll
need to re-establish contact with the outside world. I hope it happens before the mood becomes a fit.

I commission a Jet Bridge to get us out of this mess. (Get it, Jet Bridge? :trollface:)

### 5th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The graves are dug, and the first coffins are getting placed. Too bad we can't reach the bodies.

As I overlook the construction I notice that if this keeps up, we'll soon have more use for this graveyard.

Hang in there, *Shorast Unalzuntir*, a hospital is *almost* at the bottom of my list. (As in, I haven't written
it into the list yet, but I'm thinking about it now)

### 6th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The battle went worse than I considered. We are, in fact, all going to die. *Shorast Unalzuntir* and
*Doren Gusilnoram* are transformed into werebeavers. *Thob Utharnokim* has already been found dead.

![Shit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2p353j0x3G0m/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.42.21%20AM.png)

Things are not at their best in *Birdclasps*, as more hit the ground. This is not a good party they are
throwing.

![Death everywhere](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0A0O2D3P3U0q/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.45.13%20AM.png)

![Death here too](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1F1f0r0j0q1h/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.44.31%20AM.png)

### 7th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

What's left of the army focuses on *Doren*. We can only hope now, but also recruit.

![Doren](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/283t2w2d2S3T/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.47.09%20AM.png)

Since I doubt the werebeasts will kill themselves. The squad is disbanded.

![Super damnit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3E0S0G3w2c0B/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.53.37%20AM.png)

We'll have to start fresh. From what we have. And see if we can still have a life here, though, now everyone
injured should be a suspect.

We are down to 17 dwarves. This is tumbling down.

![Seriously](http://f.cl.ly/items/341B261V2j102v1l3m1S/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.05.06%20AM.png)

### 8th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Now in *Selected tragedies of Birdclasps*

*Rakust Mebdumat* is probably not long for this world, in combat he should have never seen

### 9th Moonstone, 124, Early Winter

It has happened. They have turned. It is over for now. One of them is dead.

![Doren](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0P1x0D3R1S1y/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.15.29%20AM.png)

*Shorast Unalzuntir* is the new expedition leader, inexplicably.

![Leader](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0h2h2D0T3H0L/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.17.42%20AM.png)

Interesting times we live in.

![Sure is](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1x2p411k0d1t/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.18.53%20AM.png)
