### 1st Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Things are happening, I think, but now it's a race against time and space.

As the rivers froze, I realized an important thing. I blocked everyone from the fort.

The moat was finished, but the bridge wasn't even planned. Before we can have bones, we'll
need to re-establish contact with the outside world. I hope it happens before the mood becomes a fit.

I commission a Jet Bridge to get us out of this mess. (Get it, Jet Bridge? :trollface:)
