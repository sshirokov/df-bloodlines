### 1st Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Things are happening, I think, but now it's a race against time and space.

As the rivers froze, I realized an important thing. I blocked everyone from the fort.

The moat was finished, but the bridge wasn't even planned. Before we can have bones, we'll
need to re-establish contact with the outside world. I hope it happens before the mood becomes a fit.

I commission a Jet Bridge to get us out of this mess. (Get it, Jet Bridge? :trollface:)

### 5th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The graves are dug, and the first coffins are getting placed. Too bad we can't reach the bodies.

As I overlook the construction I notice that if this keeps up, we'll soon have more use for this graveyard.

Hang in there, *Shorast Unalzuntir*, a hospital is *almost* at the bottom of my list. (As in, I haven't written
it into the list yet, but I'm thinking about it now)

### 6th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The battle went worse than I considered. We are, in fact, all going to die. *Shorast Unalzuntir* and
*Doren Gusilnoram* ar transformed into werebeavers. *Thob Utharnokim* has already been found dead.

![Shit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2p353j0x3G0m/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.42.21%20AM.png)

Things are not at their best in *Birdclasps*, as more hit the ground. This is not a good party they are
throwing.

![Death here too](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1F1f0r0j0q1h/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.44.31%20AM.png)

### 7th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

What's left of the army focuses on *Doren*. We can only hope now, but also recruit.
