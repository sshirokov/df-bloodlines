Winter
------

### 1st Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Things are happening, I think, but now it's a race against time and space.

![Yep](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2t170O260F0F/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.27.42%20AM.png)

As the rivers froze, I realized an important thing. I blocked everyone from the fort.

![Moat](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1i47110v3u0u/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.28.17%20AM.png)

The moat was finished, but the bridge wasn't even planned. Before we can have bones, we'll
need to re-establish contact with the outside world. I hope it happens before the mood becomes a fit.

I commission a Jet Bridge to get us out of this mess. (Get it, Jet Bridge? :trollface:)

### 5th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The graves are dug, and the first coffins are getting placed. Too bad we can't reach the bodies.

![Bury me with my beer](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0300373B0R0B/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.38.02%20AM.png)

As I overlook the construction I notice that if this keeps up, we'll soon have more use for this graveyard.

![Broken parts](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1z322w0K043H/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.39.19%20AM.png)

Hang in there, *Shorast Unalzuntir*, a hospital is *almost* at the bottom of my list. (As in, I haven't written
it into the list yet, but I'm thinking about it now)

### 6th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The battle went worse than I considered. We are, in fact, all going to die. *Shorast Unalzuntir* and
*Doren Gusilnoram* are transformed into werebeavers. *Thob Utharnokim* has already been found dead.

![Shit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2p353j0x3G0m/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.42.21%20AM.png)

Things are not at their best in *Birdclasps*, as more hit the ground. This is not a good party they are
throwing.

![Death everywhere](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0A0O2D3P3U0q/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.45.13%20AM.png)

![Death here too](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1F1f0r0j0q1h/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.44.31%20AM.png)

### 7th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

What's left of the army focuses on *Doren*. We can only hope now, but also recruit.

![Doren](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/283t2w2d2S3T/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.47.09%20AM.png)

Since I doubt the werebeasts will kill themselves. The squad is disbanded.

![Super damnit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3E0S0G3w2c0B/Image%202014-08-14%20at%202.53.37%20AM.png)

We'll have to start fresh. From what we have. And see if we can still have a life here, though, now everyone
injured should be a suspect.

We are down to 17 dwarves. This is tumbling down.

![Seriously](http://f.cl.ly/items/341B261V2j102v1l3m1S/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.05.06%20AM.png)

### 8th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Now in *Selected tragedies of Birdclasps*

*Rakust Mebdumat* is probably not long for this world, in combat he should have never seen

![Dying](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/441N1C3X2Z3b/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.07.52%20AM.png)

![Most things are broken](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1I1j070C0Z1p/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.10.46%20AM.png)

### 9th Moonstone, 124, Early Winter

![Back](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/340C1C2O1f1W/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.31.34%20AM.png)

It has happened. They have turned. It is over for now. One of them is dead.

![Doren](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0P1x0D3R1S1y/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.15.29%20AM.png)

*Shorast Unalzuntir* is the new expedition leader, inexplicably.

![Leader](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0h2h2D0T3H0L/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.17.42%20AM.png)

Interesting times we live in.

![Sure is](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1x2p411k0d1t/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.18.53%20AM.png)

Our hamlet now numbers **19**

![Death, everywhere](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1r0L0H1m3N3H/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.20.21%20AM.png)

And quite a few dwarves are upset. This will be SUPER !!FUN!!

![A spiral in waiting](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2z0B3l0b1c0x/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.21.45%20AM.png)

At least the **Rough Jet Bridge** is designed

![Some achievement](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0b323W1M2H3Q/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.23.12%20AM.png)

### 10th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Impressively, *Sakzul* remains in a mood

![Mood](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1c3H3d1G3i0o/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.30.03%20AM.png)

As progress is made on the bridge, which is finally designed.

![Bridge](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0V2f0Q3w4622/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.30.36%20AM.png)

We may have bones yet.

### 12th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

The bridge is built.

![Bridge](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2o3V392f163j/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.34.04%20AM.png)

Just in time for shit to start getting weird inside the walls of *Birdclasps*

![Shock](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/091d470g0x3g/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.34.51%20AM.png)

*Iteb Tashemshorast* has, understandably, been throwing fights. She lost a lot people, even
the annoying ones and has witnessed death

![Death has been seen](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/291O2R2O162W/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.37.46%20AM.png)

### 14th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

*Tantruming intensifies*

![Damn again](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3x1h0n2w1y1v/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.42.21%20AM.png)

At least he had fun starting a fight.

![Fight](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3a0W2P3k2m1A/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.44.19%20AM.png)

### 15th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

A pattern is emerging. *Tholtig Deglimush* joins the tantrum party

![Number three](http://f.cl.ly/items/2527371m1K443U3p122E/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.46.00%20AM.png)

### 19th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

*iteb Tashemshorast* takes a moment from the tantrum to give birth to a boy.

![Boy](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/252U3D093F3B/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.52.06%20AM.png)

![Boy info](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2K3o322Y1g1e/Image%202014-08-14%20at%203.54.25%20AM.png)

*Tosid Mengamith* is now the only dwarf that does not know the misery of *Birdclasps* has become. He'll learn soon.

![Death](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0T3d3i082x3U/Image%202014-08-17%20at%205.51.54%20PM.png)

![More death](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1Z1J1D3n2X1I/Image%202014-08-17%20at%205.53.47%20PM.png)

Very soon.

### On Containment

It is decided, then. The current population of *Birdclasps* has to be contained. The curse has to stop growing, before it grows
too large and damaged to control. No one must know before it's too late. Not before the suspected, innocent and infected
alike are gathered together and cast away.

The halls of *Birdclasps* will fill once more, but their cursed hands won't be there to smear blood on the walls. They'll hide
from sight, locked until some foolish dwarf builds the wrong lever and unleashes the builders of these walls.

### 21st Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

More tantrums, as the containment halls are being dug.

![Tantrum again](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/371m2g1v0n0R/Image%202014-08-17%20at%205.57.46%20PM.png)

The tantrum lasts a full day

![Gone](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0V2v3j1K3u0H/Image%202014-08-17%20at%206.00.16%20PM.png)

### 22nd Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Finally, someone decides to kill something that isn't a dwarf

![Cooking, not murder](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2E393Q1O2d47/Image%202014-08-17%20at%206.02.13%20PM.png)

Maybe something good can still come of this. Unfortunately, the yak doesn't make it to the butcher.

![Nope](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1f1g1I0y1Q1m/Image%202014-08-17%20at%206.05.56%20PM.png)

Best I can gather, it was killed on the way.

### 26th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

More coffins are placed as all the existing are filled to capacity

![Death](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1t441d151L2Y/2014-08-17%20at%206.09%20PM.png)

As progress continues on what will become the Werebeaver-run subfort within *Birdclasps*.

**They do not yet know what they dig.**

![Isolation](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2M422q3d1q3c/Image%202014-08-17%20at%206.12.13%20PM.png)

### 28th Moonstone, 125, Early Winter

Today, *Sazkul Cogsashas*, the one dwarf that was spared the bloodbath of the werebeavers has lost her mind.

![Nuts](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0w3l330X1e0m/Image%202014-08-17%20at%206.23.05%20PM.png)

I tried to get those bones for you, but something, uh, else came up.
