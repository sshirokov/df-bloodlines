Winter

### 1st Moonstone, 126

Immediately, our moat freezes over.

The lever connected to the front bridge has been connected. At least we have
some protection from whatever siege is on its way

I have Skalnik II's room smoothed and engraved, because the boss of the fort and
lone survivor of @sshirokov's first rule, I think they deserve a fancy room.

I notice some dwarves are sleeping poorly, so I start a new, larger dormitory,
and issue an order for a lot more beds. I also ask for more doors, because
apparently we have none.

I was demanded to allow Slava engrave his room, so I enable stone detailing for
him and command him to smooth his room. He takes his time, but the other sides
of the wall are smoothed immediately by other stone detailers.

I notice a tragedy.

![No booze](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/2d242N2t0o1h/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-29%20at%2010.04.42%20PM.png)

This is a problem. I've been apparently slacking on brewing drink, though I
thought I was on top of that. Oh fantastic, I find out that we've been out of
Plump Helmet seeds for who knows how long. We've been brewing the rest of our
damn food and I guess ran out recently.

![No seeds, oh good](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/1W1l3l0k470u/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-29%20at%2010.05.36%20PM.png)

I demand plants be grabbed from outside and I also demand more drink be brewed.
Luckily theres something brewable out there.

![Oh thank god](http://cloud.mikeskalnik.com/image/3I132a1S332d/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-29%20at%2010.09.32%20PM.png)

Some jobs are being canceled due to the lack of running water right now. Perhaps
we should investigate a well for the winter, so we'll always have some water.

It begins to snow outside, as I count the days until my year up at Birdclasps is
over. Dwarves, we've done well. While my leadership isn't perfect, at least I
hand the fort off without a pile of corpses and way more than 2 dwarves.

As the snow melts and the river thaws a bit, spring arrives. I wave farewell to
Birdclasps. Hopefully I'll return at a later date.
