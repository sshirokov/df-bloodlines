### 1st Moonstone, 126

Immediately, our moat freezes over.

The lever connected to the front bridge has been connected. At least we have
some protection from whatever siege is on its way

I have Skalnik II's room smoothed and engraved, because the boss of the fort and
lone survivor of @sshirokov's first rule, I think they deserve a fancy room.

I notice some dwarves are sleeping poorly, so I start a new, larger dormitory,
and issue an order for a lot more beds. I also ask for more doors, because
apparently we have none.
