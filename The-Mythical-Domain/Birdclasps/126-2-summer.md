### 1st Hematite, 125, Summer

I realize the earlier plans that the previous ruler made were due to the failed
containment. Realizing that, I just cancel the digging and expand the dining
hall and let my single mining dwarf do that and the dedicated cemetary

### 23rd Hematite, 126

Holy crap, more migrants. This fort is coming back from the dead with a force!
We're now 36 (and a werebeaver) strong.

And suddenly Kadol is taken by a mood. However, he immediately starts picking
things up and getting to work, so I guess he has what he needs. Good, good.

A claystone ring was made. I don't think its all that great, but who am I to
judge?

I go to engrave a slab for our ghost dwarven child, when I see we're going to
need a couple more slabs.

I notice a dwarf canceling jobs and go to check it out. Looks like Tekkud is
stuck in a tree and is starving and dehydrated. I trigger an alert to go
underground but he doesn't move. I turn off the alert and go to chop down the
trees around him, lets see if he survives

And with that, Summer comes to an end. That was a quick.
