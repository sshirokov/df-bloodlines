The population has fallen dangerously low.

All is not lost but we are in a dire siatuation here.

The siege is over! Hooray: Let it be known on this day we took notice that we were no longer under attack:

It seems a dwarven child (who I cannot kill) has been hurting all the dwarves around us. And a maddness stricken miner has been offing dwarves left and right and things do not look good.

The miner actually ended up killing the crazy dwarf child:

Hope, which is in very short supply now as there are not many dwarves at all left:

At last some relief, some more dwarves showed up:

And we ended up with quite a few more dwarves:

# Late Summer - Galena 

The death and destruction does not stop.

I think our broker might have killed some people, or maybe they were already dead and were just discovered. In any case, people showing up to this fort don't seem to do too well. Damn emotions, getting in the way of dwarven ambition.

An update on our popualation:

Not good, might need to repurpose those farmers to clean the place up.

How approriate it looks as if coffins are finished, not too make more as 10 surely won't be enough:

Also more death.
