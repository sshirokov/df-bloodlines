Roadclapped
----------

*Roadclapped* is the second dwarven fort established in *The Mythical Domain* on
the twenty-third of Felsite, the year of one hundred twenty-seven. @drobati the
cowerdly overseer abondoned the troubled but legendary *Birdclasps*.

It was decided that *Roadclapped* should contain, of course, the basic criteria
for a dwarf to survive. With that @drobati chose this location.

As the great @sshirokov always said, "Prepare is for elves." So with that we
settled to "Play Now!".
