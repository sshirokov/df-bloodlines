### For a sane, unified experience, we will use something resembling these settings.

If you use the vanilla client, or the [LNP](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Utility:Lazy_Newb_Pack),
we should stick to these setting to make sure no surprising interactions take place:

  * `AUTOSAVE` - `SEASONAL` - This forces the game to save at season changes
  * `BABY_CHILD_CAP` - `20:40` - 20 max total children, 40% of the population
  * `POPULATION_CAP` - `200` - Because anything less is Elven

Or as LNP puts it
