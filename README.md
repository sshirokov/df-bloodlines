The many insane rulers of [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
==============================================================================

These are the fragments collected from artifacts of the insane rulers of great forts.
Not everyone survived, but as far as our scientists can tell, everyone had !!FUN!!

### What are **The Rules**

* Anything can change with a Pull Request
* Every Overseer plays for one game year
* The overseer should name a dwarf after himself before passing the torch.
* We have no idea what we are doing.
* :beers:

### Armok is who again?

These are stories from playing *Fortress Mode* in [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) a
very detailed, free,  world simulator.

For any given fort the `README.md` will describe the progressions of
the overseers of the fort, and any decisions that led to its creation.
