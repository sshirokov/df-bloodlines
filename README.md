:crown: **THIS GAME IS CURRENTLY RUNNING v40.06** :beer:

The many questionable rulers of [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the fragments collected from artifacts of the questionable rulers of great forts.
Not everyone survived, but as far as our scientists can tell, everyone had *!!FUN!!*

### What are **The Rules**?

We will operate on the assumption that we're not malicious. Anything that needs writing down should
be written down here. This is basically our constitution.

  * Anything can change with a Pull Request
  * Every Overseer plays for one game year
  * The Overseer should name a dwarf after himself before passing the torch.
  * We have no idea what we are doing.
  * :beers:

### What do I do on my turn?

Grab the latest save from the releases. The previous Overseer should have taken care of that, if not
find them and yell at them.

Extract the save and put the `save` directory into your `$DF_ROOT/data/save` directory. Making any changes
in paths that are required, as long as the next Overseer can follow these instructions without concern.

Create a branch with the first season of your turn in the appropriate `World`/`Fort` directory in the format
`year-sequence-month.md`, where `sequence` increases as the year progresses, and `month` is just the name of the
month as reported in the `z` menu. **Push this branch right away, as you introduce yourself, and open a Pull Request**

Commit early, commit often. As the seasons change create new `year-sequence-month.md` files, and keep us posted.

The Pull Request you open will serve as your running dialog of your turn, and where everyone else can make fun of you.
When it is merged, it signifies the end of your turn, and the last few commits should update any relevant documents to
reflect that.

### Armok is who again?

These are stories from playing *Fortress Mode* in [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) a
very detailed, free,  world simulator.

For any given fort the `README.md` will describe the progressions of
the Overseers of the fort, and any decisions that led to its creation.
